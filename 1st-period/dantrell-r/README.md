# Dantrell R.

## 👋 About Me

Hi! I’m Dantrell R., a junior in high school who decided to learn computer science. It has certainly been a challenge learning a range of different languages and applications. I had no knowledge of what it meant to code and the process, then I started learning C++, then I became familiar with key concepts such as variables and what it meant to use HTML, JavaScript, and CSS. This website shows some of my best work.

## 📚 About This Project

This project is the culmination of what I’ve learned over the course of the year as a student developer. It showcases my ability to design, build, and deploy a personal portfolio website from scratch. Through this process, I’ve learned how to use GitHub Pages for deployment, write more efficient and structured code, and design user-friendly layouts using CSS Grid and JavaScript interactivity.

## 🌐 Portfolio Site Overview

My portfolio site includes:

- A clean homepage with a short introduction
- An "About Me" section detailing my background and interests in development
- A featured project gallery built with JavaScript and CSS Grid
- Links to live projects and GitHub repositories
- A responsive design that works across different screen sizes

## 🛠️ Featured Projects

- **Analog Clock**  
  This project was done on CodePen. I utilized features of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It is very straightforward. It has a long hand and short hand that represent the hour and minute. Click to view the time!

- **Calculator**  
  This project is different from the first. Instead of making something to visualize the time, I made something able to compute and work with numbers: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Give it a try!

- **Dino Run Game**  
  This project was completely different from anything I've ever done—it was a whole game. It is inspired by the Google game Dino Run but with its own version with different characters and backgrounds.
